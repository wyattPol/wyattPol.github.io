I am a final-year undergraduate student in Automatic Control and Robotics at **Poznan University of Technology**, Poland. My research interests focus on robotics, optimal control, and reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on robotic manipulation and planning for complex, dynamic tasks. 

At my home university, I have worked on projects involving legged robots under the supervision of [Prof. Krzysztof Walas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0FZ0cZQAAAAJ&hl=pl) and robotic air hockey planning and diploma thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Piotr Kicki](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=tilnVjMAAAAJ&hl=pl). These experiences have strengthened my expertise in robotic systems and intelligent planning algorithms.

Currently, I am a research intern at the **[IRIS Lab](https://irislab.tech/), Arizona State University**, under the supervision of [Prof. Wanxin Jin](https://wanxinjin.github.io/). My research, which began in the summer of 2024, focuses on optimal control and robotic manipulation, contributing to advanced methodologies for precision and efficiency in robotic systems.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the [KIMED OEKOSYSTEM](https://www.zkil.uni-luebeck.de/zkil/ki-med-oekosystem) project at the **University of LÃ¼beck and the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein** in Germany, supervised by [Prof. Floris Ernst](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ns9KHIAAAAJ&hl=de) and [Daniel Wulff](https://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/en/translate-to-english-institut/translate-to-english-mitarbeiter/translate-to-english-wulff-daniel). My work involved developing deep learning solutions for needle detection and segmentation in 3D ultrasound images, specifically for kidney interventions. I implemented models, conducted experiments, and fine-tuned solutions to enhance accuracy and reliability in medical imaging workflows.
